# Breakout in Odin & Raylib

This repository contains a small game made by following
[Karl Zylinski](https://zylinski.se/)'s
[breakout video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfgZOEvO0kM),
using the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/) and
[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

The original code written by Karl can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa2NuQ1hCODZ4NTBwUm1CN01xUTdGbHJDYTRfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsMW1obk4xTjRsTzJKWVJ6N0VlNXltbU1SS2ZLQWFsOEVSY2VIY3VScHg0YjlVaXFKN05lQ1I2SEl3OU13S3lHU05mRTY2NDFvSUFURjJKMVFSMGU1ZTQ1SG9TcDFodkJVTjFpUlZ3VVktajE4NG1xRQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkarl-zylinski%2Fbreakout%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fbreakout.odin&v=vfgZOEvO0kM).
I did some refactoring while following the video.

In this repository, the game loop resides in `breakout.odin`.

## How to Play

To play the game, you need an Odin compiler. Please refer to [the official documentation](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/)
for how to install an Odin compiler on your operating system.

Once you have an Odin compiler installed, change to this directory in your terminal and run:

```
odin run .
```
